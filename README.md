# yt.exe - Silly Program for YouTube
This is a silly program that will quickly open the desired YouTube page using a single 4 letter command. Just run the console appended yt with the command below and that's it.

Installation
---
You can install yt.exe to any location convenient for you, however, for a quick launch from the command line, it is recommended to copy it to the system folder (C:\Windows\System32\). The application has been tested on Windows 7 (x32-x64) and Windows 10 (x32-x64).

Using the app

yt.exe is a console application that takes only 1 argument, so you just need to specify the application name and command in the command line:
```
yt smlo - open Music / Study Music / Lofi
yt smjp - open Music / Study Music / Japanese
yt gadm - open Music / Game Ambience / DOOM
```

Why are there so few console commands
---
I have added only those basic commands that I myself use, so if you have any ideas what commands could be added more, I am waiting for the upcoming suggestions.

The principle of adding commands
---
The basic principle of adding new commands is simple - all old commands are left untouched. Those. each new command must be 4 characters long and cannot be the same or replace the commands already added.
